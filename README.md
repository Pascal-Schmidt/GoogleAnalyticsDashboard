# GoogleAnalyticsDashboard

The application pulls data from Google Analytics and Google Search Console and analizes some metrics of my personal blog (thatdatatho.com)[https://thatdatatho.com/]. I started my blog in my third year as an undergraduate student in 2018 and I have been blogging mainly about R since then. I have learned a lot about R, statistics, and programming since then and started my R Shiny journey in April 2020.

I dived in deeply into Shiny and learned so many new things during that year until now.

The application uses a mongodb database in the back-end to store user credentials and also stores information about what visualizations are currently viewed. Therefore, every single users who has their won credentials can create their own unique dashboard.

Upon login, users see a GIF in google colours until the app has been fully loaded. At first, value cards appear with basic metrics about my blog and show how numbers compare from the current day to the previous day. After, all the visualizations will load with the `renderUI` function. 

On the right side there is an action button that shows a sidebar menu when users click on the hamburger icon. Users can then select their choice of visualizations by clicking on the text which are action links. The text will disappear from the sidebar and the visualization is shown. I used jQuery to add and remove visualizations in order to avoid calling `renderUI` every single time a user adds or removes a visualization. Same goes for the sidebar. jquery adds and removes action links.

The visualizations that are currently active are saved in the mongodb database and every single time a user logs back in, they will see the visualizations that they have selected when leaving the app the last time. 

On the left side above the value cards, the is a down-arrow which let's user select the date range. The maximum date range is 30 days. I used `shines` to toggle down the date input widget. When a user selects a new date range, jquery removes all current visualizations and now the `renderUI` function will plot every single visualization again with new data. 

I also implemented `shiny.router`. When clicking on the "Time Series Forecast" button, users will see a time series forecast about the page views. I used an elastic net model and a tree based model to make predictions about page views for 2 months in advance. I used `timetk` and `modeltime` for this.

The application uses `shinyauthr` for users to login. The default login credentials are user1 and pass1. The application pulls live data from G
